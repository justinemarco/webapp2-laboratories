As a software engineer involved in the project, their are several factors
or aspects of the project that could have been handled better.

First, the plan of the project should not entirely focus on accomplishing 
the deliverables but also giving ample amount of time to debug, check, 
and quality check the work. In planning, estimating the project time and
resources are crucial in creating the project plan and budget,
being able to meet the deadline.

Second, the team should have a project schedule wherein it documents the 
sequence and duration of the project tasks, and deliverables. This will help the 
team to track and measure the project and performance, know if they are still on
track or not, taking action when necessary. 

Third, open communication within team members. Communication and collaboration
is key to accomplishing the project as each member is assigned tasks to do. 
This will help manage the expectations, feedbacks, and changes that may arise during
the project. 

Fourth, continue monitoring and controlling the project time and resources. 
In this part, this will help the team to identify and resolve any issues, problems, 
or risks that may affect the project outcome. By this, reporting the project status and 
performance to the team members will determine whether adjustments to the project plan
are to be made.

Lastly, members of the team should do their part. Strictly adhering to the project plan
and schedule, will ensure the success of the project, working both on time with quality. 
By implementing the accomplishment of deliverables strictly, this will ensure that the project
is still on track.

To conclude, communication, collaboration, and strictly sticking to the project plan and
accomplishment of deliverables are important to instill the project's success. Of course, 
keeping in mind, that the project plan is feasible and planned accordingly.
